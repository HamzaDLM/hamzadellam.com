                Mostly working on tooling for big companies these days but I enjoy working across the stack, from
                project
                planning to deploying and maintaining, using a large panoplie of technologies and libraries. In love
                with

                Currently working on {Easynet}, a BNP Paribas proprietary platform used globally to manage
                infrastructure device life-cycle and configuration. On the side, am working on a container monitoring
                platform that can integrate with any hardware and other hobby projects.
                <br><br>
                When am not coding, you'll find me playing piano and building hardware.
